<h3 class="h3head">PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> most eminent physicians dwell particularly upon the necessity there is
for young ladies, as they advance towards womanhood, to take active and
regular exercise; and to avoid, as much as possible, all sedentary amusements.
That love of variety, however, so natural to the human mind, and which is
particularly observable in children, renders it a matter of some difficulty to
diversify their sports, so as to discover a sufficient number of games that require
exertion: we, however, flatter ourselves that this has been accomplished,
in the little Work here presented to the reader in an English dress. They will
find in it instructions for playing at a great number of games, of such a nature
that they cannot fail of being conducive to their health; and which, while
<!--006.png-->
they afford an innocent relaxation from study, will be eminently useful in
forming that easy and graceful carriage, which can only result from the free
and active motion of the limbs, necessarily produced by frequently playing at
these games.</p>

<p>The prose part of the work has been faithfully rendered into English
from the French original; but the Proprietor is indebted to the author
of the Tours of the original Dr. Syntax, who has enriched this little Repository
of Youthful Sports, with some elegant verses, illustrative, in a moral
point of view, of the games described.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE SWING.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Madame <span class="lowercase">D’H</span>ernilly</span> was accustomed to pass, every year, several of the summer
months in the country: a particular circumstance obliged her to go there sooner than
usual, and her husband, who was one of the chief magistrates in the capital, was not
able to accompany her. Her only companions were her two daughters, both young
girls. There was very little society to be met with in that part of the country where
Madame D’Hernilly’s castle was situated: the nearest town, which was at a distance
of two or three leagues, was a small place, with but few genteel inhabitants; and,
even were it otherwise, she would not have been tempted to mix with her neighbours.
Solitude was her choice and her device, till the time of the vacation: at that period
she expected to be joined by her husband and her only son. The visits she received
<!--008.png-->
in the mean time were confined to those of two ladies in the neighbourhood, and their
daughters, and these were admitted only on condition that they brought with them no
men, not even those of middle age.</p>

<p>Adela and Ernestina, the daughters of Madame D’Hernilly, found this lonely life
very dull; in fact it suited ill with the vivacity of their age; and, in order to enliven it,
they managed to prevail upon the two ladies, their neighbours, to leave behind them at
the castle three young persons who accompanied them there on a visit. This addition
to the family was delightful to Adela and Ernestina, for they were equally in want
of employment and amusement. They had read over and over all the books they
brought with them from Paris. As their masters had not accompanied them, they
did not pursue their studies regularly, but only took occasionally a few lessons upon
the piano-forte, and of singing, so that a great portion of their time was unemployed.</p>

<p>A moralist has said, with much reason, that the mind requires relaxation; and
as it is necessary to seek employment, in order to preserve oneself from the evil habits
which are the offspring of idleness, so it is equally requisite to relieve the fatigue of
labour by recreation; a proper mixture of both keeps up the spirits, and preserves
the health of the mind as well as that of the body. In mixing with society we lose
<!--009.png-->
the remembrance of past troubles, and even present ones weigh less heavily upon our
spirits. The mind, in short, resembles a fruitful soil, like which it should sometimes be
suffered to lie fallow; or rather it may be compared to a farmer with whom a landlord
is obliged to act leniently, and to give him time for payment, for fear that by demanding
his rent too strictly, the farmer’s resources should fail, and he should be ruined.</p>

<p>Our five young friends were not obliged to rack their brains to find amusement. In
the beginning of the visit the youngest, named Adriana, taught the grown-up girls those
dances which they had learned in their childish days, but had already forgotten;
“<span class="title">My fine Castle</span>,” “<span class="title">We will not go again to the Wood</span>,” “<span class="title">The Duke de Bourbon</span>,” <span class="decoration"> &amp;c.  &amp;c.</span>
These are things out of date, we must allow, but they will always be new for children,
and our imitations of them are, after all, lifeless copies; they want the spirit of the
originals&mdash;“<span class="title">The Chevalier de la Marjolaine</span>,” “<span class="title">The Tower</span>,” “<span class="title">Take Care</span>,” “<span class="title">Hands
Round</span>,” amused even Madame D’Hernilly, who herself did not disdain sometimes to
join in them.</p>

<p>The pleasure which they found in renewing their childish games gave to our young
people the idea of taking advantage of a swing, which was already erected in the
garden. Persons of a more advanced age, and distinguished by grave occupations,
<!--010.png-->
did not look upon it as any disgrace to take the exercise of swinging, during the
months of August and September, when the castle was crowded with guests.
The posts which supported the swing were a little decayed since the preceding year,
but they were soon repaired. Madame D’Hernilly recommended prudence to the
young people in partaking of this amusement, and, as an additional precaution, she
took care to be present whenever they enjoyed it, and strictly ordered that no
one should swing in her absence. They were prohibited standing upon the seat;
neither were two persons allowed to get in at the same time; Ernestina, or Aglaé, or
another of their friends, placed themselves by turns upon the seat, which was furnished
with a soft cushion; and, while the one who took the exercise grasped the cords
tightly with her two hands, two or three of her companions pulled the end of the
cord, and thus made it go backward and forward.</p>

<p>Satiety would not have interrupted this amusement, but bad weather came on
suddenly, and it was impossible for our young folks to frequent the garden. Thus
thwarted in their favourite sport, they set their wits to work to find out some other
agreeable pastime.</p>

<p>Adriana regretted the swing less than her play-fellows: a new doll, which had been
<!--011.png-->
sent her from Paris, was her faithful companion; and, shall I add, the others envied
her happiness? They contrived, however, to participate in it, for, under the sly
pretence of amusing little Adriana, they made much of her doll. They took pains to
dress her, to curl her hair nicely, and to put on her cap to the best advantage. They
made dresses for her, and even pretty little rose-coloured silk slippers. In short, the
doll’s drawers were soon completely filled with a very handsome wardrobe.</p>

<p>They were just beginning to tire of the amusement, which making the doll’s clothes
had at first afforded them, when one morning, Aglaé, one of the young visitors, happening
to open a book by chance, read aloud, that it was by trying the effects of the reflection
and the refraction of the light through the fragile partitions of soap bubbles, that
the great Newton had discovered the properties of the prism, and decomposed the rays
of the sun.</p>

<p>Madame <a name="change1" id="change1"></a>D’Hernilly expressed her admiration of this phenomenon in natural
philosophy; but she did not understand the subject sufficiently to give her little
auditors much information upon it. “But pray,” cried Adriana giddily, “why should
we not try to make some discoveries ourselves, by blowing soap bubbles, they are
so pretty?” “Oh fie,” cried the elder girls, very consequentially; but one of them immediately
<!--012.png-->
added, “I remember to have read in La Fontaine, this excellent thought&mdash;‘Nothing
is useless to people of sense.’”</p>

<p>“It is indeed a very just idea,” said Madame D’Hernilly, “and I think, my children,
you will do well to take advantage of Adriana’s proposal.” The matter was then put
to the vote, much in the same manner as they had learned from the newspapers, the
national affairs are decided in the chamber of deputies. Ernestina, and one of the
young visitors, ranged themselves on the left, to shew that they rejected a motion for
playing at such a childish game; Adriana, and her companions, took the right side,
and they were lucky enough to secure the support of the centre, of which Madame
D’Hernilly was the only member; they had consequently a majority, and it was decided
that they should play at blowing soap bubbles. “Who knows,” said Aglaé,
smiling, “whether we shall not, like the illustrious Newton, make some new and great
discovery.” This idea raised their impatience to begin, and luckily, the preparations
for their experiment were soon made. A chambermaid brought some soap suds, rather
thick in a china basin; Adriana chose among some little bits of straw, the one which
suited best with her design, and slit the extremity in four parts, then dipped the end
she had slit in the soap suds, and blew in the other extremity of the straw. Each blew in
<!--013.png-->
her turn, and formed bubbles which reflected all the brilliant colours of the rainbow,
but which, unfortunately, were as transient as they were beautiful.</p>

<p>Madame D’Hernilly astonished the young people very much, by explaining to them
the process by which enamellers formed the balls of the thermometer: it is done by
blowing through a glass tube, the extremity of which is made red hot, and softened by
the fire of a lamp. She added, that they had adopted this method also in glass manufactories,
and that goblets, bottles, in a word, almost all the utensils which we use in
glass and crystal, are blown in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Our little band now struggled with each other, to see who should form the largest
bubble, and who should make it rise highest in the air: one of them waved her pocket-handkerchief
to make it rise higher and higher, till the bubble burst, and the illusion was
destroyed. Madame D’Hernilly, who recollected some verses on the subject of this
amusement, took the opportunity of repeating them, and impressing their moral on the
minds of her young audience.</p>

<p><span class="sc">This</span> amusement did not last longer than the morning, and at night our juvenile
group were again at a loss for something to do. Adriana was once more the first to
find out a new species of amusement. In hunting about, she, at length, discovered
some cards, and immediately began, with great alacrity, to arrange files of soldiers
<!--015.png-->
and to build houses with the cards. The elder girls found a malicious pleasure in
throwing down her houses, just as she had brought them to the last story; and in
blowing upon her soldiers in order to make them fall, just before the file was properly
arranged. As Adriana was good-tempered, she put up with their tricks quietly,
though she meditated perhaps in her own mind some method of soon taking her
revenge.</p>

<p>Madame D’Hernilly seized the occasion which the cards presented to her, to give the
young people some account of the manner in which they were first introduced. Almost
all historians agree in saying, that they imagine games with cards were first invented in
the reign of Charles the Sixth of France, in order to procure that prince some amusement
during his long illness. As a proof that this is the fact, they cite the register of
the chamber of accounts, in which there is the following passage: “the sum of fifty-six
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sous Parisis</i>, (which was a very considerable sum in those times), was paid to Jacquemin
Gringonneur, a painter, for three packs of cards, adorned with gold and divers colours,
and different devices.” This passage proves nothing more than that Gringonneur was
a card-maker, but not the inventor of any game. In making further researches, we find
that Charles the Fifth, predecessor of Charles the Sixth, had prohibited the playing at
<!--016.png-->
cards, and that they were already known in Spain towards the year 1330, under the
name of <span class="title">Naipes</span>.</p>

<p>All the European nations give to the four principal cards of each suit, the names
of ace, king, queen, and knave, according to the denominations which correspond in
each language; but the names of the four suits vary; hearts and spades are pretty
nearly the only ones, the appellations of which are analogous in the different languages.
The diamond is called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carreau</i> in French, and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">oros</i>, which means jewel, in Spanish. The
club called in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">trèfle</i>, and in Spanish <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bastos</i>, has, like the diamond, a corresponding
signification in the Spanish and English languages, because the name in both signifies
a stick. In Germany, it was formerly made like a cross, and it still retains the
name of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">kreuz</i>. These little hints may be found worthy of the attention of those
persons who seek to discover the origin of cards.</p>

<p>The young ladies questioned Madame D’Hernilly about the rules of the different
games at cards: but, upon this point, she did not think it right to satisfy their curiosity.
“It must be owned,” she said, “that we find fewer examples among women than men,
of an inordinary fondness for cards, but we cannot be too much upon our guard against
the love of play: recollect, besides, the observation, unfortunately too just, which one
<!--017.png-->
of our poets makes upon the avidity with which people sometimes give themselves up
to gaming:&mdash;‘We begin by being dupes, and end by being cheats.’”</p>

<p>“Long live our childish games!” cried Ernestina, “these at least do not occasion any
remorse.”</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE SHUTTLECOCK AND THE SEE-SAW.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> weather cleared up, and the young people resumed their usual walks in the
garden. The swing was out of order, and Madame D’Hernilly would not permit them
to make use of it till it was repaired. The imagination of our juvenile group quickly
suggested something to supply its place. A plank, placed across a very solid marble
bracket, which they happened to find on the ground in the middle of the bower, was
fastened to it by iron cramps, in order to render it more secure. The gardener, one of
those ingenious fellows to whom we give the name of jack-of-all-trades, because he
knew a little of every thing, and was besides a very decent mason, smith, and even
blacksmith, seconded the impatience of the young ladies: the see-saw was soon ready,
and Adriana and Aglaé were the first to spring upon it. They were both of them of
the same height, and about the same weight, conditions quite necessary for the players
at this game. Madame D’Hernilly watched that their alternate ascent and descent
should be managed without any jerk, which might derange the machine, or, which
<!--019.png--><!--illustration moved to end of paragraph, below-->
<!--020.png--><!--Blank Page-->
<!--021.png-->
was worse, make the young ladies, who were seated at each extremity, lose their
balance.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i19.jpg"
 width="500" height="506"
 alt="Illustration: Girls on a see-saw"
 />
</div><!--end figure-->

<p>I recollect at this moment some moral lines upon the game of see-saw; they are rather
obsolete, and the versification is not distinguished for its elegance, but the lines contain
a maxim well worth remembering, the force of which could not be heightened by the
finest language:</p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="indent0">Behold the play-game; those who rise</div>
  <div class="indent0">Seem as they would reach the skies;</div>
  <div class="indent0">But soon they find that they descend,</div>
  <div class="indent0">And to the earth as quickly tend.</div>
  <div class="indent0">Thus Fortune guides the rolling ball,</div>
  <div class="indent0">While these ascend, the others fall.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>There are some see-saws of a double construction, which are mounted upon a revolving
pivot, four persons may balance themselves at the same time upon these machines, two
and two; the one who descends touches the ground lightly, with his foot to the right or
to the left; it results from this, that the persons who play move continually in rotation
in one direction or another; this variety of motion is indispensable, for the head would
become giddy if the players moved very long in the same direction.</p>

<p><!--022.png-->
When Adriana and Aglaé were tired of their new sport, two of the elder girls mounted
the see-saw, and while they were enjoying this exercise, two others occupied themselves
with a more common amusement; each of them, armed with a battledore, threw to one
another a shuttlecock<a name="change2" id="change2"></a>. This game is too well known to our young readers, for any
description of it to be necessary.</p>

<p>Such of our little friends as are curious respecting the manners, customs, and amusements
of distant countries, may like to know, that in China, and other countries of
Asia, they play at shuttlecock with the foot. The Chinese shuttlecock, like ours, is
decorated with feathers, but they place at the bottom a small bit of lead, or some
pieces of copper money to render it heavier; they make use of the instep to push it,
as is frequently done at the game of football. The following verses were written upon
the play of shuttlecock by Pannard, and are thus translated:</p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">
  <div class="indent0">Reason, whene’er your humour’s gay,</div>
  <div class="indent0">You treat us just as children play,</div>
  <div class="indent0">When with their battledores they force</div>
  <div class="indent0">The shuttlecock in airy course.</div>
  <div class="indent0">About you beat us as you please,</div>
  <div class="indent0">Till tir’d, we wish the game to cease;</div>
<!--023.png--><!--illustration moved to follow poem-->

<p>When all the young ladies were tired of the game of see-saw, and that Adriana had
taken, or tried in vain to take, a sufficient number of butterflies, the whole party united
and continued to play at shuttlecock. It is not impossible for four or five people to
amuse themselves together, when they have a sufficient number of battledores, but it
is better to do it by turns, or in the following manner. When a player fails to send back
the shuttlecock which is sent to her, she should give up her place to another, and if the
new player fails, she also should in her turn yield her place to a fresh competitor, and
so on, till each enjoys the amusement in rotation. Such was the method pursued by
our young players; but we do not know whether disputes might not sometimes have
arisen from it, had not Madame D’Hernilly, as we before observed, always mixed in the
sports of the children, and, by her presence, prevented squabbles.</p>

<p>The famous Christina, queen of Sweden, was very fond of the game of Shuttlecock.
One day, during this queen’s stay in France, in the time of Louis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>, she asked the
learned Bochart, whom she had attracted to her court, to play with her. He did not
need much entreaty, but immediately taking off his <a name="change3" id="change3"></a>cloak, began a game with her
<!--026.png-->
Majesty. Some of his friends ridiculed his complaisance, but they were wrong; a
refusal would have been at once pedantic and ill-bred.</p>

<p>Before we quit this subject, we must say a few words respecting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sognettes</i>, or, as we
call them in English, battledores. They are, as every body knows, little hoops of
wood bent in an oval, and the extremities, united to form a handle, are kept together
by strips of white leather bound round them. The interior of the battledore is a
netting made of catgut, which is stretched lightly.</p>

<p>Those learned people who found fault with Bochart for making use of the battledore,
have written several grave dissertations, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the
ancients were acquainted with this game; those who are of opinion they were, cite
this verse of Ovid:</p>

<p>This passage of the Latin poet evidently means a net-work, upon which not shuttlecocks,
but light balls, were tossed backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>As to our young rattle-pates, they were not at all curious to learn whether the
amusement was of ancient or modern invention; leaving that to be ascertained by
graver heads, they entered with so much ardour into the spirit of the game, that time
<!--027.png-->
flew unperceived, till their amusement was at last interrupted by the castle bell
announcing the dinner-hour.</p>

<p>On the following day, as there was not a sufficient number of battledores and
shuttlecocks for every body, one of the young visitors, named Valeria, contrived a very
ingenious means of supplying their place. She took a small hoop, which she had
procured from a barrel of oysters, and bound it round with pink and white ribbon;
five or six young persons, armed with sticks, stood in a group, one of them threw
this hoop to a great height in the air, and each of them caught it and threw it up again
in her turn. When any one failed, they were obliged to quit the game for a moment,
or to give a forfeit. This is called the game of the “<span class="title">flying ring</span>,” it resembles in
many respects the play of the “<span class="title">funnel</span>,” which we shall speak of by-and-by.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in order to heighten the pleasure of the game, the players added three
little bells to the ring, and these bells striking while the ring turned in the air, served
to announce its approach.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE GAMES OF THREAD-MY-NEEDLE, AND THE WOLF.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">Madame D’Hernilly’s</span> birth-day was celebrated by her family without parade or
ceremony: the offerings upon this occasion were those of the heart alone. The
neighbouring farmers, and superior class of peasants, presented themselves at the
castle, to offer their congratulations to Madame on the return of the day; their little
girls, dressed in white, brought her flowers. Madame D’Hernilly received with pleasure
the simple offerings of these worthy people, for whom she prepared pleasures suited
to their taste. The court of the castle became the theatre of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête champêtre</i>, which
not only lasted the whole day, but was prolonged during the evening, by the light of
a number of small lamps. The villagers amused themselves with dancing, and at night
they were regaled with a simple collation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figure-->

<p>While the villagers were enjoying the dance, their children were diverting themselves
in the gardens of the castle with the young ladies and their visitors. As the
games which they commonly played would not suffice for the amusement of so many,
<!--029.png--><!--illustration moved to precede paragraph-->
<!--030.png--><!--Blank Page-->
<!--031.png-->
Ernestina, who had a very ready invention, proposed to them a new game, which she
assured them was quite original. We know that children, and particularly young
persons who are just past childhood, play sometimes at a game called “<span class="title">Who will laugh
last?</span>” The mode of playing this game is very simple; they look each other full in the
face, using at the same time every effort to preserve their gravity, and the first who
smiles, even in the slightest degree, gives a forfeit, or else her companions impose a
slight penance upon her.</p>

<p>Ernestina invented a game of this sort, in which a great number of persons might
be engaged at once. It was a trial who should remain the longest time motionless in
the same place. This play, it must be confessed, did not promise much amusement,
but the preparations were entertaining enough. Madame D’Hernilly’s daughters had
the greatest trouble to make the young villagers comprehend what they were to do;
some of them, as soon as they were placed in proper positions, and desired to remain
without moving as long as they possibly could, turned round immediately to the
opposite side, and asked, with great simplicity, what they were to do? The confusion
which resulted from these blunders was very diverting to the lookers-on. At
last every thing was arranged, and the game might have gone on smoothly enough, but
<!--032.png-->
for want of patience in the players, who very naturally got tired of this silent amusement
as soon as they began it; and, passing at once from one extreme to the other,
in which, by-the-by, they resembled many grown people, they adopted the proposal
of a pretty little peasant, to play at the game of “<span class="title">Thread-my-needle</span>.” They comprehended
with great facility the explanation which she gave them of it, and they began
to play at it immediately.</p>

<p>The young ladies, their visitors, and the villagers, took each other by the hand,
and formed a long file: they arranged themselves in such a manner that the two
tallest girls were at the end of this file, and one of the most active at the opposite
extremity. The lot fell to Aglaé to conduct the joyous band; and while the two last
remained fixed in their places, with their arms raised, she passed under them, and all
those who followed her did the same: after making a circuit, Aglaé returned between
the second and the third, then between the third and the fourth, and so on, till by
coming nearer and nearer, she found herself obliged at last to make a turn under the
arm of the young girl who was next her; this is the termination of the game. Each
of them took her turn in this manner to pass under one another’s arms, as a thread
drawn through a needle, and, directed by a skilful hand, successively runs through all
the meshes of a web.</p>

<p><!--033.png-->
This exercise does not require any particular degree of agility, the main point is to
hold each other by the hand firmly, and to take care that you do not lose your hold.
Half an hour was long enough to tire our young revellers of this game, and they had
recourse to another somewhat similar to it, called <span class="title" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">queue-le-leu</span>, or sometimes more
simply termed the <span class="title">wolf</span>.</p>

<p>They tossed up to see who should be <span class="title">wolf</span>; the chance fell upon Adriana, who stood
alone on one side during some time; her companions, holding each other by the tails
of their gowns, ranged themselves behind a tall and active female villager, who was to play
the shepherdess. It was expressly agreed upon, that Adriana should only take the last of
the flock, and the shepherdess took all possible care to prevent her getting at that
one. The struggle was a little unequal, because the shepherdess’s movements were
quicker and more abrupt than those of the poor little wolf. Fortunately, those girls
who formed the tail of the flock, had not so much strength or agility as their shepherdess,
they relaxed by degrees in their exertions, and Adriana took advantage of it
to catch the last; the file was then thrown into disorder, and they suffered themselves
to be taken one after another. As fast as Adriana made a captive, it was placed
behind her, and the flock of wolves became at last so formidable, that they completely
<!--034.png-->
surrounded the sheep, and not one of them could escape. Valeria, Ernestina,
and the others, each in their turn, became the <span class="title">wolf</span>; and when they were tired of
this game, they divided into groups, and played at “<span class="title">hide and seek</span>,” “<span class="title">puss in the corner</span>,”
“<span class="title">paquets</span>,” and other sports, which the villagers delight to play at in their rustic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</i>.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE CUP-AND-BALL, THE DEVIL, THE SOLITAIRE, EMIGRANT,
DOMINOS,  &amp;c.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> Misses D’Hernilly received from their brother a delightful present, and one
worthy of the affection which these amiable children bore to each other. Young
D’Hernilly had learned by a letter from Ernestina, that the companions whom his sister
met with at the castle, were younger than themselves, and that, in conformity to the
taste of their little friends, the Misses D’Hernilly had resumed the trifling and puerile
amusements of their childish days. Upon receiving this intelligence, Victor D’Hernilly
went immediately to one of the most elegant toy-shops, and purchased a complete collection
of all sorts of games, which he sent to his sisters by the first opportunity.</p>

<p>My little readers will easily conceive, that the arrival of this present occasioned a
grand rejoicing among the young inmates of the castle. Each vied with the other who
should first try the “<span class="title">cup-and-ball</span>,” the “<span class="title">solitaire</span>,” and the other play-things, some of
<!--038.png-->
which were unfortunately gone a little out of fashion, such as the “<span class="title">Devil</span>,” and above all,
the “<span class="title">Emigrant</span>,” the name of which alone is sufficient to indicate its origin.</p>

<p>Madame D’Hernilly who still continued to share in the amusements of the children,
was particularly attentive to them while they were engaged in these new games; she
made them keep at certain distances from each other, lest they should be hurt by the
ball of the <span class="title">cup-and-ball</span>, or by the fall of the <span class="title">devil</span>.</p>

<p>The cup-and-ball, in the management of which the celebrated Marquis of Bièvre is
said to have excelled, is of ancient origin, since mention is made of it in Rabelais. It
is composed of two parts, which are united by a small cord, the strongest, and at the
same time, the most flexible of its kind that can be procured. One of the parts is a
wooden or ivory stick, pointed at one extremity and rounded at the other; the cord
fixed in the centre of the stick, supports a large ball, pierced through the middle by a
hole, the cord which is passed through the smallest opening, comes out at the large one;
then a knot is tied at the end, which secures the ball from falling down.</p>

<p>The player begins by twirling the ball so as to give it a very quick motion in a
perpendicular direction; you must wait a few seconds till you feel that the ball begins
to move less quickly; this is the moment to throw it up, and if the aim is good, the ball
<!--039.png-->
will be caught in the cup, or with a more skilful player upon the point, which is called
the spindle. There are some players so clever, that they will catch the ball every
time; two people may play at this game by trying in a given number of throws, which
will first be able to catch the ball.</p>

<p>An ancient historian, named Estoile, tells us that King Henry the Third of France
amused himself very frequently at cup-and-ball. This game came suddenly into very
great favour in the middle of Louis the Fifteenth’s reign; it was in fact so much the
fashion, that the actresses had the cup-and-ball in their hand even upon the stage.</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Emigrant</span> was at one time quite as much in vogue, and it deserved it, on account
of its singular mechanism, which though very simple causes it to remount of itself the
whole length of the cord from which it descends. The <span class="title">Emigrant</span> is a double disk, made
of ebony or ivory; the two parts of this disk are united in the centre by a ball, which is
of the same shape, and which forms a single piece; the ball is pierced with a hole,
through which a cord is passed, the cord is knotted at the extremity in the same
manner as the string of a cup-and-ball. You wind this cord round the ball, and then
raising it by one end, you let the toy drop, retaining only the end of the cord; the toy
falls, but it has acquired a force of rotation, which obliges it to roll itself round the cord
<!--040.png-->
in an opposite direction, and it thus winds itself up almost to the very end of the cord.
It would in fact return of itself into your hand, only that a part of its impulse is
destroyed by the friction and the resistance of the air; you are therefore obliged to
second its motion by the alternate play of the hand. The <span class="title">Emigrant</span> descends and ascends
without ceasing, unless it gets deranged by the string getting out of the rut, which is
formed by the middle of the ball.</p>

<p>You may play with the <span class="title">Emigrant</span> not only by giving it a vertical motion, but also a
horizontal one; and you may make it go, if you choose, like a censer, but this last
method is not free from inconvenience, for if the string should chance to break, the
disk may hurt the people who are near the player, or it may smash the looking-glasses
or china.</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Devil</span> is a toy still more dangerous to furniture; it is indeed so much so, that one
cannot without imprudence play with it in a room. Most people remember this noisy
plaything, for it was much in vogue a few years ago. It is in some respects, the reverse
of the <span class="title">Emigrant</span>; but it is moved by the same principle. It consists of two hollow balls,
which are cut out of the same piece of wood, and united by a common stalk. Sometimes
instead of wood, the toy is composed of tin, pewter, or even crystal; it is hardly
<!--041.png-->
necessary to observe that the <span class="title">Devils</span> of this last substance are the most expensive and
the most fragile. Each ball is pierced with a hole into which the air enters, and from
which it escapes with impetuosity as the instrument turns round; a continual noise
results from this, similar to that made by a German top. The rotation of the Devil is kept up
by the alternate play of a small cord, suspended between two sticks placed in each hand
of the player. You may throw this plaything very high, even to the distance of fifteen
or twenty feet, and yet retain it upon the string; but this cannot be done without
exposing the poor <span class="title">Devil</span> to the chance of falling every instant; and it does not long
survive repeated falls.</p>

<p>It seems likely that this game has been brought from India by the English, for it has
been long known in China, and it is represented in some engravings sent from China, by
the missionaries thirty years ago.</p>

<p>Adriana, although the youngest of the girls, had seized upon a toy, the use of which
requires both stillness and reflection; consequently, she did not expect much amusement
from it. It is called the <span class="title">Solitaire</span>, because it can be played by a single person.</p>

<p>The <span class="title">Solitaire</span> is a sort of octagon table, in which thirty-seven holes are made in the
following order; three upon the first row, five upon the second, seven upon the third,
fourth, and fifth, five upon the seventh, and three upon the eighth and last row.</p>

<p><!--042.png-->
The thirty-seven holes receive little pegs of bone or ivory which are taken out at
pleasure; but you must leave one of the holes towards the middle empty. You take
the pegs at this game in the same manner as at draughts, jumping in a straight line over
those who leave behind them an empty space. You may take away the pegs in whatever
way you think proper, but at the end of the game there must remain only one peg; if two
or three, or a greater number, should remain so separated, that they cannot be taken one
after another, the game is lost.</p>

<p>The combinations of this game are very varied, and after you have won one game, you
find it very difficult to play another exactly in the same manner. This difficulty is a good
deal increased by the manner in which players exercise themselves, in leaving at different
times a hole empty in various parts of the board, first in one place, and then in another.</p>

<p>There was at this time a continued and heavy fall of rain, which obliged our young
friends to remain for some days within doors. Fortunately, Victor’s liberality enabled
them to amuse themselves as well in the house as in the open air. In the parcel he had
sent to them, there were two sorts of shuttlecock; the one we have already described,
and another in which the shuttlecock is received on each side in a sort of funnel
attached to a long handle. This exercise is less active than battledore and shuttlecock,
because it is necessary that both the players should stand in a straight line. The
<!--043.png-->
dining-room was sufficiently spacious to admit of their playing this game with perfect
convenience<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span>.</p>

<p>Adela and Ernestina laughed very heartily at seeing Tee-totums among their brother’s
presents; even Adriana herself thought that this play was somewhat too childish;
nevertheless, after they had ridiculed Victor for sending them Tee-totums, they demonstrated
at last by playing with them, that his foresight was not useless. When they had
played at this game in their infancy, they had never troubled themselves to seek the
signification of the letters marked on each side. All their pleasure consisted in trying
who should make the totum spin the longest. Sometimes they themselves made a totum
of a button-mould into which they drove a nail, a pin, or a little wooden peg. When
Madame D’Hernilly explained to them what was meant by the letters engraved in black
on the sides, they conjectured that the amusement had been invented by grave professors
of science, or at least by some of their pupils, who had made a certain progress; for
each of these letters P. A. D. T. is the initial of a Latin word expressing divers chances
of the game. The letter P. is the beginning of the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pone</i>, which signifies put
<!--044.png-->
down; the person who throws it is obliged to put down a counter to the pool. The
letter A. is the initial of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">accipe</i>, that is to say, <dfn>receive</dfn>; the player who throws it gains a
counter. D. the first letter of the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">da</i>, in English <dfn>give</dfn>, obliges you if you turn
it up, to pay a counter. If T, the first letter of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">totum</i>, which signifies <dfn>all</dfn>, should turn up,
you take all that is in the pool.</p>

<p>We need hardly tell our young readers, that it is from this word <dfn>totum</dfn>, that the game
takes its name. There are some totums that have a greater number of sides than others;
this causes an infinite variety in the game, and greatly increases the chances of gain or
loss. The totums with twelve sides, do not differ much from a ball in form; but they
are not turned upon a pivot, they are only rolled by the hand. The sides are numbered
up to twelve, he who gains the highest point wins the game, and as this play does not
require any profound combinations, they have given it the familiar name of <dfn>Jack</dfn>.</p>

<p>“It is a pity,” said Adriana, “that Victor did not send us a <dfn>Jack</dfn>.” “Oh,” cried Adela,
“we may manage to have one with two dice, which will produce the same numbers from
two to twelve.” Madame D’Hernilly surprised her daughters very much by proving to
them, that at the game of dice, the chances were not equal, and that they would find by
calculation, it was probable they might throw one number more frequently than another.</p>

<p><!--045.png-->
In the first place, you can never throw the simple number 1, because you are obliged
to make use of two dice; the lowest number you can produce, must therefore be 2,
which is formed by the two aces; there is consequently only one means of producing this
number: 3 may be formed in two ways, that is to say, with the ace of one die, and the
2 of another; and then with the 2 of the first, and the ace of the second.</p>

<p>Number 4 may be formed in three ways, by the double 2, by 1 and 3, and by 3 and 1.
Number 5 has four chances, namely, 2 and 3, 3 and 2, 4 and 1, 1 and 4.</p>

<p>6 may be thrown in five different ways; first, the double 3; second, 2 and 4; third,
4 and 2; fourth, 5 and ace; fifth, ace and 5.</p>

<p>The chances are most in favour of the number 7; it may be formed first by 6 and ace;
second, by ace and 6; third by 5 and 2; fourth, by 2 and 5; fifth, by 4 and 3; sixth,
by 3 and 4.</p>

<p>The numbers which follow these, decrease in the same proportion as the preceding
ones have augmented; therefore there are five chances for number 8, as there are for
number 5; the 9 like the 4 has four chances; the 10 is gained in three ways like the 3;
and the 11 is made by two different combinations like the 2; lastly, the number 12
can be produced only by the double 6.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to understand these combinations at the games of tric-trac, or
<!--046.png-->
backgammon; the knowledge of them, in fact, constitutes the whole art of placing the
men skilfully.</p>

<p>Players at different games, down even to the very game of <span class="title">goose</span>, have made use of
these combinations in order to calculate the probable chances of the different numbers.
There is an infinite variety of drawings upon pasteboard designed for these games.
The game of the <span class="title">goose</span>, and similar ones, are disposed from 9 to 9; but you cannot stop
there, and it is not possible to arrive at the last number 63, till you have surmounted a
great number of obstacles. As a proof of this, we need only observe how often it
happens, that when a person is nearly at the end of the game, and upon the point of
winning it, he throws 6, which is one of the most common throws, and thus going beyond
the required number is obliged to begin the game again. The <dfn>bridge</dfn>, the <dfn>well</dfn>, the <dfn>prison</dfn>,
and <dfn>death</dfn>, that is to say, the figures which represent these quicksands, are arranged in
such a manner, that one falls into them by the numbers 6, 7, and 8, which come every
instant. In speaking upon this subject, Ernestina said facetiously, that a comic poet was
not in the wrong in making one of his personages say:<span class="lock">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container no-break">
 <div class="poem">

<p>Adela, who had seen her parents play at tric-trac, asked the meaning of the words
<!--047.png-->
carmes, sonnes,  &amp;c., which she had heard pronounced at this game. Madame D’Hernilly
informed her, that they call the two aces <dfn>leset</dfn>; the two trays <dfn>ternes</dfn>; the two fours
<dfn>carmes</dfn>; the two fives, <dfn>quines</dfn>; the two sixes <dfn>sonnez</dfn>. There is no particular denomination
for the double deuce.</p>

<p>With three dice, the chances are still more multiplied, and it would be very easy to
calculate them; three points alike are called <dfn>raffle</dfn>, that is to say, a raffle of aces, a raffle
of trays, a raffle of sixes,  &amp;c.  &amp;c.</p>

<p>From explaining the chances of the dice, Madame D’Hernilly turned to that of the
<span class="title">osselets</span>, or knuckle bones, which the ancients used nearly in the same manner as we do
dice. They placed two or three in the dice box, and they reckoned a certain number of
points according to what was turned up. The game was, however, looked upon only as
a childish amusement. Phrates, king of the Parthians, wishing to reproach Demetrius,
king of Syria, for his habitual levity, sent him some golden <span class="title">osselets</span>.</p>

<p>Our children employed the little bone which is found in the leg of mutton, and
which we call cramp-bone, or else small pieces of ivory cut to resemble it. The
convex side is called the back, the opposite side which is concave, is called the
hollow, and the two other sides are called the flat sides. The <span class="title">osselet</span> is thrown up
<!--048.png-->
into the air, and before it falls, the player is obliged to place those which remain upon the
tube one after another upon the back, upon the hollow, and upon the concave side;
another osselet is then thrown up, and before it returns into his hand, he must
successively snatch up all those which are on the table, or else he must make them pass
under the thumb and forefinger of his left hand, which is extended; these different
combinations are called making the <dfn>back</dfn>, the <dfn>hollow</dfn>, the <dfn>wells</dfn>, the <dfn>fricassee</dfn>, the <dfn>raffle</dfn>,  &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Misses D’Hernilly, and their young friends amused themselves very little with the
<span class="title">osselets</span> which Victor had sent them; they declared that such a fatiguing game was fitter
for boys than girls. But though they thought little of the <span class="title">osselets</span>, they prized very
highly a superb set of dominos, which were made of mother-of-pearl, and had the spots
marked with golden nails. Madame D’Hernilly thought that this elegant token of
Victor’s affection for his sisters, would not be very long safe in the hands of those little
rattle-pates and their giddy associates; she therefore took charge of them herself, and
presented the children with a common set in their stead.</p>

<p>Each Domino is divided into two parts, and each part presents seven combinations;
namely, the six points of the dice, and the white space: it is for this reason, that the
dominos are 28 in number. Each player takes at random a certain number of dominos,
<!--049.png-->
which he places before him in such a manner, that his adversary cannot distinguish how
many there are. The person who has a double six, or for want of that, a double five, or
any other number doubled, begins the game: the others, for three or four may play at
it, place by turns, a corresponding domino to one of the extremities of the domino
which is put upon the table. If any one has not a domino to correspond with the others,
he is passed by, and loses his turn; this is called <dfn>sulking</dfn>. When there are only two, it
is called <dfn>fishing</dfn>. You take at first very few dominos, for example, three, or at most five.
When you <dfn>sulk</dfn>, instead of letting your adversary play, you draw from the dominos which
remain, until you have drawn the required number; in consequence of this, it sometimes
happens, that the player draws more than half the set. The game is won by the player
who has first used all his dominos. If the game is closed, and that no one can place their
remaining numbers either to the right or the left, he who has the smallest number of
points, or if the points are equal, who retains the least number of dominos, wins the
game. The winner reckons in his favour the number of points which his adversary
has not been able to place, and they begin again until one of the players has gained
the number 100 as at picquet.</p>

<p>The young neighbours were obliged to absent themselves for a few days from the
<!--050.png-->
castle, they soon however returned; and they passed whole evenings in playing at
dominos. Each of the players marked by means of a card the numbers they had gained.
Madame D’Hernilly informed them, that their manner of reckoning up their numbers,
by cutting a card in different places, had a great resemblance to the <dfn>abacus</dfn>, which the
ancient Romans made use of in counting; and the <span class="title">souan-pan</span>, which the Chinese employ
for the same purpose.</p>

<p>On one side is a large hollow, with four slits to mark the units; on the other side is
a mark reckoned equal to fifty, and four others, which are each equal to ten. You
might by this means, count beyond ninety-nine, but in multiplying the slits, you might
go to several millions, or even millions of millions.</p>

<p>This kind of arithmetic is much more expeditious than that of writing down and
adding up columns of figures, but it is attended with one very great inconvenience, that
of leaving no trace of detached calculations; so that you cannot ascertain afterwards
whether you have not committed some error.</p>

<p>The children’s fondness for dominos, subsided at last like their other whims, and
they condescended to play with the <span class="title">onchets</span>. Adriana deceived by the similarity of
sound between this word and <span class="title" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échecs</span>, the French name for chess, supposed they were
<!--051.png-->
the same game; Madame D’Hernilly explained the difference, which was very considerable;
but although she was tolerably skilful at chess and draughts, she thought
that their combinations were too complicated for young people. “When you are
older,” said she, “I will make you acquainted with a charming poem, written by
Cérutti on the game of chess; but in order to comprehend the poem, you must be
acquainted with the rules of the game. I shall content myself to-day with reading
you some verses descriptive of the subject.”</p>

<p class="p2">When Madame D’Hernilly had read the verses, they renewed their conversation about
the game of <span class="title">onchets</span>. “The grand question,” cried Madame D’Hernilly, “is whether
these little ivory fish, or these figures of kings, queens, knaves, and horses, should be
called onchets, honchets, or jonchets; those who make very laborious researches after
the most trifling things, assure us, that we should say <dfn>honchets</dfn>, because the word may
be used to signify little men. I am of the opinion of those who call them <dfn>jonchets</dfn>, which
is derived from the game being originally played with straws, instead of these little
sticks of ivory and gold. After all, my children, there is no need to trouble ourselves
respecting the name of the game, the only essential thing about the amusement is that
it should divert you.”</p>

<p>This game is most amusing when played by two persons only, although it is possible
for three or four to join in it. They draw lots to decide who shall begin; the player who
gains the chance, holds in his fingers one of these little hooks, the other takes the bundle
of fish and figures which he strews over the table; the first then seizes with his hook
upon as many of them as he can catch, but it requires a great deal of address to do this
<!--053.png-->
according to the rules of the game; for if the pieces in contact with the one which you
covet happen to move in the slightest degree, you are obliged to resign your turn to
your adversary, and this continues on both sides till all the pieces are taken.</p>

<p>The young people easily comprehended the instructions of Madame D’Hernilly, and
soon became proficients in the game; they reckoned the king for fifty, the queen forty,
the knave thirty, the horse twenty, and each plain fish for ten. The player who contrives
to get together the greatest number of points, wins the game.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">HIDE-AND-SEEK.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">It</span> is still a question among the players of this game in France, whether one should say
hide, hide, Mitoubat, or hide, hide, Nicholas? The frolicksome group whose plays we are
describing, did not care a jot which was most proper; in fact, they seldom gave themselves
the trouble to reason either upon the names or the choice of their diversions. They were
induced to engage in this, from a circumstance which we are about to mention. The
amusements which were practised at the castle of D’Hernilly, were very much talked
of in the neighbourhood, and the fame of their sports drew a number of youthful visitors
to the family. We have before observed, that young ladies alone were admitted; among
those who presented themselves were several new-married ladies, who did not blush to
join again in the innocent diversions of their childhood. The young ladies and their
visitors passed a whole day in juvenile sports, without feeling a moment’s uneasiness,
except when the hour came which by summoning them to partake of a repast, interrupted
their games.</p>

</div><!--end figure-->

<p><!--057.png-->
There are several ways of playing at Hide-and-Seek: sometimes one of the children
went and hid herself in a dark corner, as far as she could from the others, but always
within a certain distance; the others then ran about in every direction within this space
to find her, and the one who succeeded in doing so, concealed herself in her turn in the
best hiding-place she could find. The ladies’-maids, and some of the other female
domestics, exerted their skill to aid those who wished to hide, in discovering the
most secret corners; but care was always taken to avoid all dangerous places, as, for
example, steep stairs, from whence they might have been precipitated at the moment
when they were on the point of being seized.</p>

<p>Another way of playing at hide-and-seek, is to form a circle, and to set a person to
seek through it for a particular object, which each of the others contrives to conceal
from her view; a pocket-handkerchief, a snuff-box, or, in short, any toy or trinket, will
serve for this purpose. Formerly they used to make use of a slipper, but always upon
the express condition, that it should be very clean: this is, however, a shabby sort of
expedient, and ought to be proscribed in good company: when it is adopted the game is
called <span class="title">Hunt-the-Slipper</span>.</p>

<p>Our readers will readily conceive, that the Misses D’Hernilly and their companions,
<!--058.png-->
did not condescend to hunt the slipper: but when they were tired of hide-and-seek in
the way we have described, they seated themselves in a semi-circle upon the grass, in a
very picturesque part of the garden, where flowers, of the most varied and beautiful hues,
at once delighted the eyes, and gave a delicious fragrance to the air.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Valeria, one of the new comers, voluntarily offered to play the dull part
of the seeker. A young lady went round the circle holding up the drapery of her shawl,
in order that Mademoiselle Valeria, who held her hand before her eyes, promising at the
same time not to cheat, might not see to whom she gave the handkerchief.</p>

<p>As soon as she had given it, she cried aloud, “It is done;” at this cry, Mademoiselle
Valeria began the round; the pocket-handkerchief which she pursued with ardour,
circulated rapidly from hand to hand, and was concealed by the players in the folds of
their dress. It is necessary for the seeker to guess exactly who the person is who holds
it, and to seize her in the act. Poor Valeria found it very difficult to do this, for at the
moment that she thought herself sure of finding the handkerchief, the one who held it
slily slipped it to another, and it arrived in the twinkling of an eye, at the very extremity
of the circle.</p>

<p>After a long and vain search, Valeria succeeded at last in seizing the handkerchief in
<!--059.png-->
the hand of Adela, who being now obliged to become a seeker in her turn, retired to a
fountain, and turning her back to her companions, waited till it was time to begin the
search. She did not wait long, the signal was speedily given, and, more lucky than
Valeria, she was only a few minutes before she succeeded in discovering and seizing the
handkerchief. A third and a fourth speedily took her place in turn. At last, Ernestina
suffered the handkerchief to be found in her possession. This was a real triumph to all
the rest, because Ernestina was supposed to understand the game better than any of
them, and she was, besides, very active, so that it was extremely difficult to catch her;
in fact, she would have escaped then, if a mischievous neighbour had not purposely been
too long in receiving the handkerchief which she passed to her.</p>

<p>They cried bravo on all sides, and mischievously determining to tease Ernestina, they
formed a little plot against her, while she was standing on one side, waiting for the game
to begin. The hour approached for leaving off play, and they quickly agreed to finish
with a little cheating trick. The pocket-handkerchief for which Ernestina was to seek,
was placed at a great distance under a tuft of flowers, and they made believe to pass it
from hand to hand. Ernestina was completely duped by this stratagem; her young
friends’ hands moved with so much rapidity that she never perceived they passed
<!--060.png-->
nothing; for, to render the illusion more complete, they every now and then shewed her
the corner of a gown, the end of a shawl, or sometimes another handkerchief. Ernestina
eagerly caught hold of what she saw; but she was soon made sensible of her error, by
long and loud bursts of laughter. However, she took these disappointments very gaily,
and passed rapidly on, first to the right, and then to the left, till she became fatigued and
out of breath. The mirth of her young friends grew more noisy; their suppressed
laughter and whisperings, and perhaps also some inadvertence on the part of the youngest
players, warned her at last, that they were making game of her. “I am certain,” cried
she, “that the handkerchief is at a distance from this spot, and that you only make believe
to pass it, and that is not the game.” They were obliged then to confess the trick they had
played her. Ernestina was half inclined to be angry; but she had been often told that
ill-humour alters the prettiest features; and perhaps this idea had some share in making her
quickly get the better of hers; for she immediately resumed her gaiety, and returned to
the castle, saying that she should one day take her revenge. Her comrades defied her to
realize her threats; when she promised them that they would be caught sooner than they
expected. Perhaps, after all, she was herself the first who was caught; for at her age
we are easily deceived, because the credulity, natural to youth, lays us open to imposition.</p>

<p><!--061.png-->
Madame D’Hernilly, to whom Ernestina related her adventure, laughed very heartily
at it, and said it was not the first time people sought to discover mysteries, where there
were none. She gave, as an example of this, the following singular anecdote of the
celebrated Catherine <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, Empress of Russia. This sovereign was one day surrounded
by some of the gravest of her courtiers, and becoming tired of their pedantic dissertations,
she said, “Permit me, gentlemen, to interrupt for a moment the important
discussion in which you are engaged, in order to consult you about a charade which I
have read in the last <cite>Mercure de France</cite>, and which I cannot solve. It is this; ‘my first
is a cavity, my second is a cavity, my whole is a cavity.’”</p>

<p>Our statesmen, with all the suppleness of true courtiers, turned their conversation
immediately from politics to the charade. Nothing could be more easy than to find
hollow objects, which might be supposed to form one of its three parts; but they tried
in vain to discover any term which could be applied to the whole. The Empress made
a pretence to slip out of the room, leaving her counsellors profoundly occupied with their
endeavours to solve the charade, which they were heartily vexed at being unable to do
at last. The next day, however, they discovered that the Empress had merely been
amusing herself at their expense, for they found that there was no such charade in the
latest <cite>Mercure de France</cite>, which had arrived at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petersburgh.</p>

<p><!--062.png-->
This was not the only time that Catherine sought, by jokes of this kind, to divert the
ennui attendant upon a throne; and to lighten the painful yoke of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">etiquette</i>. We might
relate more than one trick of this sort which she has played, not merely upon different
persons, but very often upon the inhabitants of a whole city. On more than one
occasion, the people of the capital have tormented themselves during whole days to
discover the solutions of problems and enigmas, which in reality had no meaning.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">BLINDMAN’S BUFF, AND HOT-COCKLES.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> next day the family were once more alone, and the young people were obliged
to find out games which did not require such a considerable number of players. Blindman’s
Buff was the first that was chosen by this joyous little group. Adriana, as the
youngest, had her eyes bound, and ran after her companions. Madame D’Hernilly
took upon herself to call out, in order to warn the one who was blinded, when she
approached too near a tree, or any other object that might endanger her safety. Adriana
ran about during some time without catching any body; at last Ernestina suffered
herself to be caught, out of compassion no doubt, and she pursued her young friends
in her turn. This play lasted the greatest part of the day, but a storm coming on
towards evening forced them to seek a shelter, and they retired to the drawing-room. As
they complained of being obliged to leave off their game, Adela advised them to
continue it in the hall, which was very spacious.</p>

<p>Madame D’Hernilly disapproved of this proposal, because she thought the game
<!--066.png-->
would endanger the furniture; but being always desirous to contribute to the amusement
of the children, she told them that they might play at <span class="title">Blindman’s Buff sitting</span>. This game
is not attended with any risk to the furniture, and may be played without inconvenience
even in a small room; it is besides more amusing perhaps than the other, particularly if it
is played by candle-light.</p>

<p>The young people applauded Madame D’Hernilly’s idea; but they agreed at the same
time that they would not begin to play till after dinner. They had scarcely dined when
visitors arrived, whose company was almost as tiresome to the mistress of the house,
as to the children. Our young readers will easily conceive with what impatience the
latter waited for the moment when the departure of the guests, would leave them at
liberty to begin their sport. At last it arrived, the visitors retired, and our gay young
troop immediately formed themselves into a circle in the middle of the saloon. As
Ernestina was to be blinded, they covered her eyes with a muslin handkerchief; every
one then changed their place, and she was conducted into the middle of the group, and
had the liberty of seating herself upon the knee of whatever person she pleased; but
she was obliged, without putting her hands upon the person whom she touched, to guess
who it was.</p>

<p><!--067.png-->
As the young folks were all differently dressed, the touch of their clothes would
furnish an easy means of discovering them, but they did every thing in their power to
prevent the one who was blinded from profiting by this circumstance: Adriana, who
had a plain cambric muslin gown on, drew upon her knees the skirt of her next neighbour’s
Merino pelisse. Ernestina deceived by the touch, exclaimed that it was Madame
D’Hernilly or Adela; they called out, triumphantly, “Wrong! wrong!” and poor
Ernestina had to begin her round again.</p>

<p>This game amused them during the whole evening, and they liked it so much, that in
some days afterwards they began to play at it again, with as much eagerness as the first
time; but they varied the manner of playing at it, and by so doing, heightened the
amusement it afforded them. This new method, which we must call playing blindman’s
buff in shadow, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>One of the young ladies stood facing the wall, and she was enjoined not to look behind
her: an Austral lamp was placed upon a table at the bottom of the saloon, and there
was no other light in the room. All the party then passed between the lamp and the
person who stood with her face to the wall, so that their shadows fell upon the wall; the
<!--068.png-->
lady who stood with her face to it, was obliged to guess as each shadow passed whose
it was.</p>

<p>Madame D’Hernilly’s daughters, and their young companions, exerted all their
ingenuity to disguise their figures, that they might avoid being caught. At first they
passed pretty quickly in succession, because they were not yet well acquainted with
the game; but at the fifth or sixth game, when Madame D’Hernilly occupied the post
facing the wall, they made use of all the little artifices they could think of to lead her
into error. Ernestina, Adela, and Adriana, vied with each other in endeavours to disguise
their shadows most effectually. Their postures were so whimsical, that Madame
D’Hernilly could not succeed in discovering any one.</p>

<p>To increase the difficulties, they resolved to put a cheat upon her, and slily brought
a young servant girl to take a part in the game without her knowledge. This
girl presented herself at first with a gardener’s hat on; and presently afterwards, she put
on the pouch and belt of the game-keeper, and clapped a villager’s cap upon her head.
After that she crawled along upon her hands and feet with a postilion’s jack-boot upon
her arms. Madame D’Hernilly was obliged to say that she “<cite>threw her tongue to the
dogs</cite>.” This phrase is used to signify that you give up; and uncouth as it sounds in our
<!--069.png-->
language, Madame de Sevigné has condescended to employ it in one of her most
sprightly letters<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span>.</p>

<p>They deliberated upon the penance which they should inflict upon Madame D’Hernilly;
and they agreed that she should be obliged to embrace those of the company whom
she loved best, and that she must do it without making the others jealous. She tenderly
embraced her daughters and their young friends; and though her preference for her
daughters was too natural to be doubted, they did not perceive that there was any difference
in her manner of caressing them, and their companions. She therefore fulfilled
the express condition of the penance, which was in fact a pleasure, rather than a
penance to her.</p>

<p>They then played one more game; Ernestina soon found herself in the same situation
as Madame D’Hernilly, and she was consequently obliged to submit to a penance.
They gave her a fable to read, of which the following lines form the concluding
moral:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><!--070.png-->

  <div class="indent0">’Twere better then, amid the strife</div>
  <div class="indent0">That mingles in the scenes of life,</div>
  <div class="indent0">As the best guard ’gainst those who flout you,</div>
  <div class="indent0">To keep an open eye, and look about you.</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>These childish amusements were interrupted for some time by the arrival of a new
present from Victor, the kind brother of the Misses D’Hernilly: it consisted of some new
music. Their father had added several instructive books to Victor’s gift; and the young
ladies were delighted with both. Their occupations now became as serious as possible;
they were engaged the whole day at the harp, the piano, and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Solfeggio</i>; they
hardly allowed themselves even a short interval to walk in the garden, gather flowers, or
admire the beauty of the fruits which were approaching to maturity.</p>

<p>If by chance bad weather obliged the company to confine themselves to the drawing-room,
the young people read extracts from voyages and travels, written in such a manner
<!--071.png-->
as to suit their capacity, divested of those scientific details which are uninteresting to
people of the world, and cleared at the same time from all that could be detrimental to
the youthful and delicate mind. These extracts united all that is most pleasing in
history and romance, and they were free from the dryness of the one, and from all that
is dangerous in the other.</p>

<p>One evening Madame D’Hernilly took her work-basket into the park, where she
seated herself at the foot of a majestic oak, surrounded by beautiful plane trees, and
began to amuse herself with her work. The young visitors, of whom we have spoken,
had left the castle for some days, on account of a slight indisposition of their mamma,
but they came to pass this evening with Adela and Ernestina. The young people
amused themselves with roving about the park; the evening was delightfully serene, the
last rays of the setting sun were gradually disappearing before the brilliant disk of the
full moon, which arose at the opposite extremity of the horizon in mild and cloudless
majesty. The lovely serenity of the scene invited the young friends to the pursuit of
rural pleasures, but the heat of the day was not sufficiently abated, to enable them to run
about and give themselves up without restraint to active exercise. Madame D’Hernilly
found that it was too dark to pursue her embroidery any longer, when the young
people came and grouped themselves about her. Adela proposed to return to the house
<!--072.png-->
and practise some music. “We should do much better,” cried Adriana, “to stay here.”
“But what should we play at then?” cried one of the others. “Oh,” replied Adriana,
“at what you will, no matter, provided it is play.” “Let us dance hands round,” said
Ernestina. “No,” said Adela, “it is too hot.” “Well then, let us play at blindman’s
buff.” “Oh,” cried Adriana, “we have played at that so much; besides, I am always
afraid you will cheat me, you know how you caught me the last time.”</p>

<p>Adriana alluded to a little trick which her companions had put upon her. Three
weeks before, they played one day at blindman’s buff upon a very extensive lawn,
which was surrounded on all sides by gravel walks, where there was no breakneck
place to fear. It was expressly settled that they should not go beyond the lawn, and
that whoever passed its limits, should be looked upon as caught, and submit to be blinded
accordingly.</p>

<p>It was Adriana who was blinded, and on the faith of their agreement, she went quietly
groping about for almost a quarter of an hour; meantime, the other rogues all passed
the lawn, and mischievously left her to seek them in vain. When she found out the
trick she was almost angry, and even Madame D’Hernilly reproached the others gravely
for having broken their express agreement.</p>

<p>Ernestina proposed that they should play at a game, the movements of which do not
<!--073.png-->
require much activity; it is blindman’s buff with the wand. “What is that?” cried
Valeria. “Oh,” said the frolicksome Ernestina, “I will soon shew you.”</p>

<p>They hastened to gather from the banks of a little rivulet which ran through a garden
laid out in the English taste, a pliant branch of a weeping willow; they stripped it of all
its leaves, and left it about a foot and a half long. They were proceeding to draw lots to
ascertain in the usual way who should be blinded; when Ernestina, who was very good-natured,
offered of her own accord to take the disagreeable part of the blind one: the
others accordingly put a bandage over her eyes, and made sure that she could not see,
when they gave her the wand to hold. Each of the others then took hold by turns of the
opposite end of the wand, they put it to their lips and whispered a few words, endeavouring
at the same time to disguise their voices. Ernestina who had proposed the game, and
who was supposed to be well acquainted with it, became the victim of her good-nature, for
she remained a long time unable to guess at any of the whisperers; she was lucky
enough, however, to succeed at last, and each of the others were obliged to submit to be
blinded in their turn.</p>

<p>Adriana shewed a good deal of cleverness at this game, and managed for a long time
to avoid being caught; at last, the one who was blinded contrived by a little sly trick to
<!--074.png-->
make her betray herself. She threw her off her guard, and in her surprise, she spoke
without disguising her voice; she was consequently immediately recognised, and triumphantly
seized. It was Ernestina who played this trick, which Adriana resolved
should not pass unrevenged, and accordingly she made use of every effort to catch
Ernestina, who being the cleverest of the party contrived for a long time to escape.
Adriana might easily have seized upon Adela, or Valeria, but it was Ernestina only that
she wished to catch, and at last she succeeded.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figure-->

<p>When Ernestina’s eyes were bandaged, Adriana went to Madame D’Hernilly, who
had till then remained seated at some distance without taking any share in the game,
but at the desire of Adriana, she now drew near and held the wand. While she thus stood
facing Ernestina, she remained silent, and the adroit Adriana, who was close to her,
muttered a few words, interrupted every now and then by a titter. As Ernestina knew
nothing of Madame D’Hernilly’s holding the wand, she guessed repeatedly, but always
in vain. At last, wearied out with her ill luck, she declared she gave it up, and Adriana
to complete her little revenge, acknowledged the stratagem she had practised, saying,
“So you see, Ernestina, the plotter is caught in his own trap.” This joke terminated
their sport at blindman’s buff, but as it was yet too early for them to retire to their
<!--075.png--><!--Blank Page-->
<!--076.png--><!--illustration moved to precede paragraph-->
<!--077.png-->
apartments, they determined to finish the evening with another game; and they made
choice of Hot-cockles. Madame D’Hernilly, who wished to put an end to their little
tricks of deceiving and cheating one another, practices which we hope our young
readers will condemn as being highly improper, determined to play herself the part of
the <dfn>confessor</dfn>; each of the young people came in succession, and placing her hand upon
Madame D’Hernilly’s lap, spread her right hand upon her back, and remained in this
position which is called, being the <dfn>penitent</dfn>, till she could guess who struck her.</p>

<p>The rules of this game are extremely simple, but there is one precaution necessary
in playing it, that of not striking too violently. Excesses of this sort were not much to
be apprehended where the players were all young ladies; however, we must confess,
that some of them felt inclined to give heavy blows; Madame D’Hernilly, who saw this,
took great care to rein in their impetuosity. She obliged them also to the strict
observance of the rules, one of which was, that two persons should never strike at the
same time. Whenever this happened<a name="change4" id="change4"></a>, the person who gave the last blow, ought to take
the place of penitent; and Madame D’Hernilly took care always to inflict the penalty
with inflexible severity.</p>

<p>While they were at play, the nursery-maid came to tell them that supper was ready.
<!--078.png-->
Ernestina wanted her to hide behind a bush for a little while, and then to strike Adriana,
who, of course, would be a long time before she could guess who gave the blow. Madame
D’Hernilly, who regretted having in a former instance lent herself to a deception, even
though it was an innocent one, would not permit this little deceit to be practised. She
broke up the game, and the children found, in their light and simple supper, a refreshment
after the fatigues of play. They then retired to bed, where exercise, combined with
their temperate repast, ensured them good repose.</p>

<p>There is also another description of hot-cockles, called “Brother, they strike me.”
There are two penitents, the one who finds himself touched with the corner of a pocket-handkerchief,
calls out to the other, “Brother, they strike me.” The other replies,
“Who strikes you?” and the first one must guess. But one of the players is a false
brother; sometimes he himself strikes, and sometimes his companion; he takes care not
<!--079.png-->
to name himself. The game does not finish till the person upon whom the trick is
played perceives the cheat; but if his comrades are clever, the illusion may last a good
while. The false brother complains that they strike him too violently, and is the first
to call out and to complain of the trick. At the expiration of a certain time he gives up
to another, who purposely allows himself to be caught; and this serves to prolong the
joke and the game. At last they own to their deceived comrade, the trick they have
been playing him, and they comfort him by telling him, that in future he may catch
others in the same manner.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE HOOP AND THE SKIPPING-ROPE.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">A complete</span> change took place at the Castle of D’Hernilly; the master of the house
and his son arrived to pass the vacation at the castle. The gentry of the neighbourhood
also hastened there to enjoy the last fine days of autumn. Several young companions of
Victor renewed their acquaintance with him, and they gave themselves up to games
much less sedentary than those played by the ladies. The young people of both sexes
very rarely met during the week-days, but they walked and conversed together on the
Sundays and holidays; sometimes during the latter they amused themselves with
country-dances in a temporary ball-room raised in a grove. Victor, who played very
well on the flute, was occasionally one of the musicians, but more frequently appeared
among the dancers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div><!--end figure-->

<p>When the boys had a holiday, they amused themselves in the park with noisy sports,
such as prison bar, leap frog, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cheval fondu</i>,  &amp;c.  &amp;c. The little ones played at the poison
ball, the skipping-rope, and the hoop. Madame D’Hernilly’s daughters were very
<!--081.png--><!--illustration moved to precede paragraph-->
<!--082.png--><!--Blank Page-->
<!--083.png-->
frequently the witnesses of these sports; they admired the cleverness which the boys
shewed, but they did not envy them their amusement.</p>

<p>One day, Victor and his friends went with their preceptor, a walk of some miles to join
in a village feast. Adriana and Ernestina found in the hall several of their playthings
mingled with the books, maps,  &amp;c., which they used at their studies. Among the rest
they found a hoop, and a skipping-rope. They were impatient to try whether they could
use these with any dexterity; though at the same time, they were a little ashamed to be
seen at such masculine exercises. Their young neighbour Valeria conquered their
scruples; she said, that she had been in a school where the young ladies were permitted
to play at these games, because their governess considered that they afforded a
healthful exercise, but the players were obliged to observe that moderation, which the
delicacy of their sex, as well as their tender age, required.</p>

<p>They found Valeria’s reasoning very good, and they determined to practise the games
with that moderation which she recommended. The weather, which till then had been
very warm, changed on a sudden; a cold sharp wind had succeeded to the most suffocating
heat. Nothing could be more healthful, therefore, than those games which required
activity.</p>

<p><!--084.png-->
As there were only two hoops, they resolved to make use of them by turns.
Each had recourse to the assistance of a stick to enable her to manage the hoop, which
she trundled sometimes forward, sometimes on one side, and sometimes she turned it
round. It was agreed that the game should be adjudged to be won, by the lady whose
hoop arrived first at the goal without its having fallen to the ground.</p>

<p>This was a matter which could not be managed without great difficulty, on account of
the turnings and windings which they had to pass; the trees, hedges, and other obstacles
also made the hoop upset every moment. Added to this, the young ladies in imitation
of what they had seen their brothers do, were mischievous enough to try to take advantage
of those who played with them, and by pushing their hoops a contrary way, to
occasion those of their competitors to fall, in order that they themselves might have a
better chance of being first at the goal.</p>

<p>While two of them were amusing themselves at this game, the others having seized on
a skipping-rope, made their young friends skip alternately. The two young ladies who
held the cord moved it circuitously, but gently; a third, and sometimes several of them
jumped with their feet close together through it. Sometimes they practised the most
difficult steps which they had learned from their dancing-master, or tried who could
<!--085.png-->
rise the highest from the ground in cutting capers. The most boisterous endeavoured
to imitate the boys, and like them they asked for <dfn>vinegar</dfn>, that is the term which they
use when they want the rope to go more quickly.</p>

<p>When Victor and his companions returned, they were quite delighted to find that the
young ladies had been playing at their games. Victor proposed the next day that they
should all play together; but the young ladies very properly refused. They contented
themselves with being spectators. The boys, who were some of them first-rate players
both at the hoop, and the rope, shewed considerable skill and strength. Victor excelled
in the double leaps, the chevaliers or knights’ cross, and he even performed several triplets
with infinite grace and lightness.</p>

<p>The player who performed, without interruption, the greatest number of the knights’
double crosses, won the game. The cord turned with so much swiftness in Victor’s hands,
that you could hardly believe he held it if you had not heard it whiz in the air, for it
passed between his feet and the floor of the apartment without touching either, and it
was almost imperceptible to the sight.</p>

<p>When they had each amused themselves singly, as long as they liked with the rope,
they formed into groups of six or eight, to dance in the middle of the long skipping-rope.
<!--086.png-->
The first who touched the rope with his foot stopped the play; he was obliged, by way of
penance, to stand on one side, and was left out of the game till some one else had failed
in it.</p>

the right, and the other with the left hand. We must, however, observe, that they
cannot do in this manner, either the double turns, or the knights’ cross; it would be
difficult, if not impossible. It is necessary to move so as to keep time exactly; both
parties must also turn the rope with the same degree of swiftness. When the movements
of the players are perfectly in unison, they may overrun a good deal of ground
without the motion of the cord being interrupted.</p>

<p>The Misses D’Hernilly, to whom this idea had been communicated, took advantage
of it to run races with the rope. Nothing could be more graceful than their manner of
performing those races; several grown-up people, who were lookers-on, agreed that
the skipping-rope, thus used, was as conducive to health, as it was useful in giving the
young ladies an easy and graceful carriage, and that they might amuse themselves with it
not only without impropriety, but with advantage.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">BOWLS, NINE-PINS, AND SIAM.</h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="sc">The</span> premature coldness of the air forced the company at the Castle to renounce all
sedentary amusements. While the ladies and gentlemen occupied themselves with
billiards; the boys played at bowls, ball, humming-top, and German top. The young
ladies got hold of the bowls and nine-pins. They were lucky enough to discover three
places which had been purposely adapted for this amusement, in a part of the garden
which was very little frequented by Victor and his companions. Some of them, who did
not like bowls, amused themselves with playing at Puss-in-the-Corner. (<cite>See the
<a href="#frontis">Frontispiece</a>.</cite>)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i91.jpg"
 width="500" height="320"
 alt="Illustration: Girls playing nine-pins"
 />
</div><!--end figure-->

<p>The ground destined for this game was a straight path, which had on each side a
small bank, to hinder the bowl from running out of the path. They divided the bowls
equally, and they drew lots to determine how they were to play. The lady, who drew
Number one, threw the <dfn>jack</dfn>, that is to say, the only small bowl at a distance; the <dfn>jack</dfn> is
regarded as the goal; the player then rolled one of her bowls as near as she could to
<!--091.png--><!--illustration moved to precede paragraph-->
<!--092.png--><!--Blank Page-->
<!--093.png-->
it. Number two came next; the one who drew it, tried to approach still nearer to the
goal, or to displace the bowl which the preceding player had thrown. Numbers three
and four followed in their turn.</p>

<p>Instead of each playing upon their own account, the best method is to form two
parties, every member of each party having the same interest. The art of the game
consists sometimes in <dfn>drawing</dfn>; that is to say, to drive at a distance the adversary’s bowl,
if it has approached very near the goal, in order that the player who follows you, may be
able to get nearer the goal than your adversary.</p>

<p>While the Misses D’Hernilly and their young companions were playing at this game,
they were frequently teased by their nursery governess, who kept calling out to them,
“Take care, young ladies, you will dirty your clothes.” They often disputed which had
won the game by approaching nearest the goal; and as, on these occasions, there was
sometimes less than half an inch difference, the thing was not easily determined.</p>

<p>Speaking of this game, reminds us of a strange circumstance which happened to the
celebrated Marshal Turenne. As he was one day walking upon the ramparts of a city
in which his troops then were, without servants, or any mark of distinction, he was
accosted by a group of workmen who were playing at bowls, and who begged that he
<!--094.png-->
would decide a difference which had arisen between them about the game. The
Marshal measured the distance with his cane, and then pronounced judgment. The
man against whom he had decided, revenged himself by abuse. The Marshal smiled,
which irritated the angry player still further. At this moment, the officers belonging to
the Marshal’s suite, came up and addressed him as my lord; the poor workman, equally
frightened and ashamed when he found whom he had insulted, threw himself at
Turenne’s feet, to implore his pardon. The Marshal raising him, said kindly, “My
friend, you were wrong in supposing I would deceive you.”</p>

<p>Our young players had very seldom any dispute at nine-pins, for it was easy to reckon
the nine-pins that were thrown down, and those which remained standing. Madame
D’Hernilly put the young ladies in mind of an anecdote which is related in the memoirs
of the younger Racine. The great poet Boileau became disgusted with poetry in his old
age, and grew passionately fond of nine-pins. Such was his address, that sometimes
he threw down the nine with one stroke. “Acknowledge,” cried he one day, “that I
possess two great talents, which are equally useful to the state and to society; that of
playing at nine-pins to perfection, and that of writing tolerable verses.”</p>

<p>When the game is played with small nine-pins, and that you throw the bowl only
<!--095.png-->
a short distance, the players throw alternately; but it more frequently happens, that a
player has two throws running, and this is the manner in which they proceed. Number
one throws his bowl at a distance to the place marked for the goal; he must, in this
first throw, knock down at least one pin, otherwise he is obliged to remain there for a
time; this is what they call making <dfn>white cabbage</dfn>, and he gives up the turn to the
player on the opposite side. But if he has thrown down one or two pins, and particularly
that in the middle, which alone reckons for nine points, he throws a second time,
throwing the bowl from the place in which it has previously stopped. He then reckons
the points he has gained, and leaves the place to Number two, and so on. The grand
difficulty of this game is not to make more points than is necessary: the number is usually
21; and if, after having gained 19 points, you happen to throw down two pins, you win
the game; but if you are so unlucky as to throw down three or four, you <dfn>burst</dfn>, and
are obliged to begin the game again. This occasions great variety, and renders the
strength of the two players equal. It requires a great deal of practice to enable you to
gain the dexterity necessary to knock down at once a considerable number of nine-pins,
and you can never be certain of throwing down one, two, or three, just at the moment
you wish.</p>

<p><!--096.png-->
Adriana had less taste than the others for this game, it required too much precision;
and, at the same time, a degree of strength above her age.</p>

<p>Ernestina, Valeria, and the rest of the eldest girls, received, about this time, a present
of a set of nine-pins, of a different sort from those we have been speaking of. They
compose the game called <span class="title">Siam</span>. You lose at it, also, by making too many points; and
you are then said, as in the other, to <dfn>burst</dfn>. Your fate is decided more frequently by
chance at <span class="title">Siam</span> than at nine-pins, for you cannot always guide the quoit at will, which
serves to throw down the pins. The quoit is made of a hard close wood, the edge of it
is cut a little sloping, so as to describe a curve it is directed circularly either to the
right or to the left.</p>

<p>This game is very common in India, and as it was introduced into France during the
reign of Louis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>, by people in the suite of the ambassador of Siam, who was at that
time at the Court of Versailles, it has retained the name of their country.</p>

<p>The nine-pins are not all of the same value; those which are ranged in a circle reckon
each for one point; three others which form the point of the opposite side count for 5, 4,
and 3; the one in the middle is called the Siam, but it is necessary to throw that down
by itself, otherwise the player loses all the points he has gained before, and is obliged to
begin again.</p>

<p><!--097.png-->
The rock upon which the player is apt to split, is, as we have already said, the going
beyond the number of points fixed upon; and no skill can avert this danger which may
arise from the slightest chance, such as the least unevenness of the ground, or even a
little sand upon the quoit; from causes thus trivial, the game is frequently lost, just at
the moment that the player appears to be on the point of gaining it.</p>

<p>Our young people amused themselves, for the rest of the autumn, with a review of the
games which had delighted them during the spring and summer; they returned to the
capital in the beginning of November. The young ladies eagerly resumed the lessons
which they took from their different masters. Victor, who for the first time, obtained a
prize at the University, entered into a higher class, where he strove with a laudable
emulation to surpass his fellow collegians. The Misses D’Hernilly, instructed by the
first masters in the knowledge of languages, and in every other accomplishment
suitable to their rank, passed their leisure hours in society, selected for them by their
mother, and chiefly under her own eye. Between study and relaxation their time flew
rapidly, but both the young ladies and their brother, often recollected with pleasure, the
amusements they had enjoyed at the castle D’Hernilly, and looked forward with delight,
<!--098.png-->
although without impatience, to the period when returning to the country they should
once more resume their healthful and exhilarating sports.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
